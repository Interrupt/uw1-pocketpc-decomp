# Run the demo_*.txt regression suite against build/uw_asan (an
# ASan-instrumented build -- see CMakeLists.txt's uw_asan target) and
# report which scripts crash. Mirrors the ad-hoc loop used throughout
# this session's playtesting/bug-fixing work.
#
# Runs under AddressSanitizer by default: a plain debug build only
# catches a crash when a bad read/write happens to hit unmapped memory,
# which silently misses plenty of real bugs (confirmed live -- ASan
# caught a heap-buffer-overflow in blit_sprite_row_remapped that never
# once crashed build/uw_dbg). Pass BIN=build/uw_dbg to fall back to the
# plain, faster, non-instrumented binary if you specifically want to
# skip ASan's overhead (e.g. iterating quickly on a known-unrelated
# script) -- ASan roughly doubles run time and memory use, and its
# reports abort the process on the FIRST error rather than continuing.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-regressions.sh                  # run the default script list
#   ./run-regressions.sh foo.txt bar.txt  # run only these scripts instead
#
# Tweakable via env vars:
#   BUILD=0                 skip running build.sh first (default: 1, builds)
#   TIMEOUT=60               seconds to wait for a hung script before
#                            force-killing it -- each script's own actual
#                            run time is whatever it takes to finish; this
#                            is just a safety net, not a fixed delay
#   OUT_DIR=/tmp/regress_out directory for per-script logs
#   BIN=build/uw_asan        binary to run (build/uw_dbg for a plain,
#                            non-ASan build -- see above)
#   EXTRA_ARGS="--container-autoclose-on-drag-out --light-mode=dos"
#                            extra command-line options forwarded to the binary for every script
#   EXTRA_ENV="UW_DEBUG_INV=1"  legacy form of EXTRA_ARGS: extra env vars (space-separated
#                            KEY=VAL pairs) forwarded to the binary for every script
#   SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy    SDL video/audio drivers for the runs. Default to SDL's
#   SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy    headless "dummy" drivers so the suite never opens a real window,
#                            takes focus or plays sound; set them to empty (or e.g. cocoa /
#                            coreaudio) to watch a script run on screen.
#   ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0   passed straight through to the ASan
#                            runtime. Off by default because
#                            LeakSanitizer isn't supported on this
#                            platform at all (confirmed live: with
#                            detect_leaks=1 the binary aborts on launch
#                            with "AddressSanitizer: detect_leaks is not
#                            supported on this platform" before running
#                            anything) -- this isn't tuning out noise
#                            from known benign leaks, ASan simply
#                            refuses to start otherwise here.
#
# All scripts are launched at once, each against its own (headless, see above) SDL window, and
# run concurrently rather than one at a time -- each uw_asan instance only
# ever touches its own window/log/demo file, and demomode's mouse
# injectors no longer warp the real OS cursor (see uw_inject_mouse_down's
# comment in gx_stub.c), so nothing about one run's input stomps on
# another's.
#
# Note: demo_automap.txt is deliberately excluded from the default list
# -- it's a 4000+ line tile-by-tile traversal that takes 5+ minutes,
# too slow for a routine regression check. Pass it explicitly as an
# argument if you want to run it anyway.
