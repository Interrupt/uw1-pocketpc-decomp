/* --- Real MOD playback backend (vendored HxCModPlayer + SDL2 audio) ------
 *
 * The decompiled MOD engine construct_and_load_mod_player/
 * start_mod_player_playback/stop_mod_player_playback (and the ~1400 lines
 * of dynamic-array/channel-mixing machinery under them in audio.c) can
 * never run safely on this 64-bit host: every one of their internal
 * "dynamic array" structs stores a cpp_operator_new() allocation in a
 * 4-byte field and reads it back later as a real pointer, which silently
 * truncates any real 64-bit heap address (see DAT_00087454's own comment
 * in audio.c, and cpp_operator_new's in ordinal_stubs.c, for the full
 * investigation/root cause). Rather than refactor that struct layout
 * across 20+ functions, background music is played through this small,
 * separate backend instead, hooked in at the exact same call sites inside
 * audio.c's play_music_track/resume_music_playback/set_music_enabled/
 * shutdown_music_module (see each function's own comment) via the
 * platform_music_* functions declared in platform_music.h --
 * construct_and_load_mod_player, start_mod_player_playback and
 * stop_mod_player_playback themselves are left completely untouched and
 * still unreachable from there (cpp_operator_new is still the same
 * hardcoded-NULL stub it always was).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into DAT_0023c3b8 or shared with the sound-
 * effect/voice-sample call sites (trigger_sound_sample_note,
 * play_numbered_voice_sample, stop_current_audio_handle(_dup),
 * is_voice_sample_finished, stop_voice_sample): those all gate on
 * DAT_0023c3b8 being non-NULL, which was never reachable before this
 * change (cpp_operator_new always returned 0) and is deliberately left
 * exactly that way -- DAT_0023c3b8 is never assigned a value anywhere in
 * this backend, so every one of those call sites stays precisely as
 * dormant/silent as it already was. Fixing sound effects/voice samples is
 * out of scope here; this backend is music-only. */
