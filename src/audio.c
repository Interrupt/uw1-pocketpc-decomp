   decompile-introduced bug. Widened both arrays by one defensive slot

// guard, decompiled as literally as the rest of the gate was. Two real
// call sites reach this live: handle_starvation_penalty (player.c,
// fires whenever the player starves) and set_sound_effects_enabled
// (hud.c's sound-effects toggle UI / player.c's settings load), both
// via stop_current_audio_handle_dup -- so this is a real, reachable
// crash during ordinary gameplay, not a hypothetical. Adding the same

// was FUN_00073140 -- the low-level sound-sample trigger: lazily

// as a one-shot note into the module player (load_and_resample_wave_sample/
// arm_sfx_trigger_slot/start_sfx_trigger_slot), all through the audio interface
// DAT_0023c3b8.
//
// BUG FIX (real SFX playback): the body below (gated by
// `DAT_0023c3b8 != 0`) has never once executed -- DAT_0023c3b8 is the
// dead decompiled MOD engine's COM-style handle, deliberately never
// assigned a value anywhere in this codebase (see platform_music.c's
// block comment) -- and even if it somehow were non-NULL,
// load_and_resample_wave_sample's own FindResourceW/LoadResource calls
// are hardcoded-0 stubs (ordinal_stubs.c) feeding a struct-packing
// scheme that's the same 64-bit-unsafe disease as the MOD engine's
// (see platform_sfx.c's own block comment for the full chain). Resource
// id param_1+800 really is a genuine "WAVE"-type PE resource embedded
// in data/UU.exe (36 of them, ids 801-859 with gaps -- confirmed via
// direct PE parsing), so play it through the real platform_sfx backend
// instead, ahead of the dead gate below rather than inside it -- same
// shape as play_music_track's own real interception sitting ahead of
// its dead construct_and_load_mod_player chain. The original body is
// left completely untouched/still unreachable underneath, exactly like
// the MOD engine's own dead code.
//
// INVESTIGATED (no volume/pan parameter to forward): param_2 here is
// the volume allocate_and_play_sound_channel forwards on from
// play_positional_sound_effect/play_sound_effect_with_pan's own
// distance/pan math (see allocate_and_play_sound_channel's own
// comment) -- but a live Ghidra decompile of the real FUN_00073140
// shows only ONE formal parameter (param_1); its body never reads a
// second argument at all. So in the real original compiled game,
// volume was computed, forwarded this far, and then genuinely
// dropped -- never reaching the actual sample trigger. platform_sfx_play
// below is deliberately a plain `(resource_id)` call for the same
// reason: there's no real volume value from this call chain worth
// forwarding, and the 36 extracted WAVE resources are themselves mono
// PCM with no stereo image to pan in the first place. This is a
// confirmed fact about the original binary (not a guess from "mono
// WAVs probably didn't need panning"), so no volume/pan parameter was
// added to platform_sfx_play's own interface -- see platform_sfx.h's
// own comment for where that conclusion is recorded for the backend
// side too.

// initializes its pattern/instrument/channel-state arrays, opens and
// reads the MOD file named/handled by param_2 (FindFirstFileW/ordaudio_op_2135),
// and -- if the open succeeds -- parses the ProTracker header tag
// ("M.K."/"6CHN"/"8CHN"/"FLT4"/"FLT8") to pick a channel count, then
// walks the instrument-header table building each instrument's sample
// length/repeat-offset/repeat-length fields (read_mod_word_length_field).
// Returns param_1 itself (the now-constructed object), matching every
// call site's `DAT_0023c3b8 = construct_and_load_mod_player(alloc_ptr, path_handle);`
// idiom. param_3/param_4: declared but every one of this function's 3
// call sites passes only 2 arguments, and the body only ever stores them
// (never branches on them) into a 12-byte scratch block with param_2
// that gets released via BatteryDrvrGetLevels right before returning -- this
// looks like Ghidra mislabeling local scratch stack slots as incoming
// parameters (same shape as a real 2-parameter function), not a genuine
// dropped-argument bug, so left alone rather than "fixed" on no evidence.
