/* --- Real SFX playback backend (PE resource extraction + SDL2 mixer) ----
 *
 * trigger_sound_sample_note's own decompiled body (audio.c, "was
 * FUN_00073140") triggers sample id param_1+800 as a one-shot note by
 * calling load_and_resample_wave_sample(DAT_0023c3bc, DAT_0023c540,
 * param_1+800), which in turn calls FindResourceW/LoadResource to pull
 * resource id `param_1+800` of type "WAVE" (the literal string, not
 * the numeric RT_* constant -- see u_WAVE_0008686c in audio.c) out of
 * the running module. Confirmed via direct PE-level parsing of the
 * real data/UU.exe (a genuine Windows CE PE32/MIPS executable): it
 * really does embed exactly 36 "WAVE" resources, ids 801-859 with
 * gaps, each an 8-bit mono 11025Hz PCM RIFF/WAVE file -- this is a
 * real, separate asset pool, not a guess and not related to the
 * MOD-tracker engine's own internal sample tables.
 *
 * None of that chain can ever run, though, for two independent
 * reasons:
 *
 *   1. FindResourceW/LoadResource (ordinal_stubs.c) are both
 *      hardcoded-0 stubs -- same shape as cpp_operator_new's stub that
 *      permanently killed the MOD engine (see audio.c's "Real MOD
 *      playback backend" block comment) -- so
 *      load_and_resample_wave_sample's very first call always fails.
 *   2. Even with real resource APIs, load_and_resample_wave_sample's
 *      own internal struct-packing is the identical 64-bit-unsafe
 *      disease as the MOD engine's: it packs a cpp_operator_new()
 *      pointer into a slot's +0x12..+0x15 fields 1 byte at a time via
 *      4 separate `*(char*)(...) = (char)(...)` writes, then
 *      reconstructs it with CONCAT13/CONCAT12/CONCAT11 -- silently
 *      truncating any real 64-bit heap address. Not safe to fix in
 *      place across its many call-site-adjacent helpers; a fresh
 *      parallel path, exactly like the MOD engine's, is built here
 *      instead.
 *   3. trigger_sound_sample_note's own body is additionally gated by
 *      `if (DAT_0023c3b8 != 0)`, and DAT_0023c3b8 (the dead decompiled
 *      MOD engine's COM-style handle) is deliberately never assigned
 *      a value anywhere in this codebase now -- see platform_music.c's
 *      own block comment for why. So even a hypothetically-fixed
 *      load_and_resample_wave_sample would still never execute.
 *
 * Sound effects are played through this small, separate backend
 * instead, hooked in at trigger_sound_sample_note's single call site
 * (see that function's own comment in audio.c) via platform_sfx_play
 * -- called directly, ahead of (not inside) the dead DAT_0023c3b8
 * gate, the same way play_music_track's real interception sits ahead
 * of its own dead construct_and_load_mod_player chain.
 *
 * Extraction: a minimal, targeted PE resource-directory parser below
 * (pe_load/pe_rva_to_offset/extract_all_wave_resources) -- NOT a
 * general-purpose PE library, just enough to read the DOS/PE headers,
 * find the resource data directory entry, walk its 3 levels (Type
 * "WAVE" -> numeric resource ID -> language) via the section table
 * for every RVA->file-offset conversion (never assumed identity), and
 * copy each resource's raw RIFF/WAVE bytes out. This runs once, at
 * platform_sfx_init() time, writing any resource not already found at
 * data/SOUND/SFX/<id>.wav (see path choice below) so every later
 * platform_sfx_play() call is a plain WAV file load, not a repeated PE
 * parse.
 *
 * Path choice: data/SOUND/ already holds the \SOUND\uwNN.mod music
 * tracks and (as a sibling pool, out of scope here --
 * play_numbered_voice_sample) \SOUND\VOCnn.wav files side by side, no
 * subfolder. These 36 WAVE resources get their own data/SOUND/SFX/
 * subfolder instead of sitting loose next to those, because unlike
 * the MOD/VOC files (which ship as real files in the original
 * install) these never existed as standalone files at all -- they are
 * synthesized here, once, by extracting them out of UU.exe, so a
 * dedicated subfolder makes that provenance obvious at a glance and
 * keeps 36 new files from cluttering data/SOUND/'s existing listing.
 * Filenames are just "<id>.wav" (the raw resource id, e.g. 801.wav),
 * matching the id-keyed lookup trigger_sound_sample_note already does
 * (param_1+800) and nothing else -- no extra padding/prefix needed
 * since these aren't matched against any original install manifest.
