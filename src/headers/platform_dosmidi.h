/* Optional DOS-audio backend: the original DOS game's own audio path, as a
 * Sound Blaster Pro played it -- XMI music and MIDI-note sound effects
 * rendered through an emulated OPL2, driven by the real ADLIB.ADV driver
 * model and the game's real UW.AD timbres.
 *
 * Everything that touches the vendored OpenAbyss audio layer lives behind
 * this header (see third_party/openabyss/VENDORING.md). That layer is a
 * reverse-engineering of ADLIB.ADV: the AIL sequencer, its voice layer and
 * the chip. This port supplies only the files, the clock and the output.
 *
 * Why this rather than a general MIDI synth: UW1's sound effects are not
 * samples and not plain notes either. Each one is a note on a *custom*
 * timbre from UW.AD's bank 1 -- selected by MIDI controller 114 -- and
 * those bank-1 timbres are time-variant effects, little command streams
 * that ramp the frequency, levels, feedback, multipliers and waveforms at
 * 60Hz. That is what makes a door sound like a door instead of a beep, and
 * it cannot be expressed as a static instrument, so a MIDI-file player
 * cannot reproduce it.
 *
 * Strictly opt-in. The default audio path remains the ARM/WinCE one
 * (hxcmod .MOD music, UU.exe WAVE-resource SFX), and the DOS assets are
 * optional -- nothing here runs unless the player asks for it AND the
 * assets are present. */

/* Is DOS audio mode live? True only when UW_AUDIO_MODE=dos (case-
 * insensitive, matching UW_LIGHT_MODE=dos in 3d.c/player.c) and
 * platform_dosmidi_init then succeeded in loading every file it needs.
 * Reports false after a failed init, so missing assets degrade to the
 * normal path rather than to silence or a crash. */

/* The audio mode this run resolved to, before any file is opened:
 * UW_DOS_AUDIO_OFF (the ARM/WinCE path), UW_DOS_AUDIO_DOS, or
 * UW_DOS_AUDIO_HYBRID.
 *
 * UW_AUDIO_MODE decides it when set. When it is NOT set the answer is HYBRID
 * if the game's data directory is itself a DOS install, and OFF otherwise --
 * a DOS data directory has no .MOD music or WAVE effects to fall back on, so
 * leaving it on the ARM path would mean silence.
 *
 * Separate from platform_dos_audio_enabled(), which reports whether the
 * driver actually came up: the mode can be HYBRID and the driver still fail
 * to start because a file is missing. Exposed so that decision can be
 * inspected and tested without a complete set of DOS audio files. */

 * timbres, as a Sound Blaster Pro played it. "hybrid" keeps that driver
 * for the music but takes the sampled effect where the port has one,
 * falling back to the DOS note for the ids it does not -- effect ids 0,
 * 13, 14, 15, 19 and 21-23. Those samples appear to be Ultima Underworld

 * so AW is the matching set -- which is also the set the DOS game itself
 * loads when the AdLib driver is in use. Its own two digits are already

 * channel and plays the note, releasing it when the duration runs out.
 * A no-op when the id has no record.
 *
 * `velocity` is the caller's distance-attenuated volume (0..0x7f) and

 *
 * MEASURED: velocity genuinely scales the output (0x7f/0x3f/0x1f on one
 * effect peak at 2572/900/588, and 0 is silent). `pan` currently does
 * NOT, and cannot: the chip behind ADLIB.ADV is an OPL2 (YM3812), which
 * is mono -- its nine channels are summed to one output, so a real AdLib
 * could not place a sound either. It is forwarded anyway because the
 * driver accepts CC 10 and the value is correct; realising it would mean
 * the SB Pro FM driver (SBPFM.ADV) over a stereo OPL3, which is a

 * (stop_movement_sound_handle, called from movement.c around the
