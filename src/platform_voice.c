/* --- Real voice-sample playback backend (SDL2 WAV player) ---------------
 *
 * play_numbered_voice_sample's own decompiled body (audio.c, "was
 * FUN_000738c4") is gated by `if (DAT_0023c3b8 == 0) return 0;` --
 * DAT_0023c3b8 is the dead decompiled MOD engine's COM-style handle,
 * deliberately never assigned a value anywhere in this codebase (see
 * platform_music.c's own block comment), so that body has never once
 * executed. Its sibling query/stop functions (is_voice_sample_finished/
 * stop_voice_sample) are gated the same way (and is_voice_sample_finished
 * in fact has NO such guard at all -- see the live-crash finding below).
 * This is a real, separate asset pool (confirmed below), so it gets the
 * same treatment as the MOD engine and the PE-resource SFX pool: a
 * fresh, small, parallel backend, hooked in ahead of the dead gates.
 *
 * What the real dead body actually does, confirmed via a live Ghidra
 * decompile of FUN_000738c4 (ARM, address 0x000738c4) rather than
 * trusting this file's own earlier, partially-wrong inline comment:
 *
 *   1. It copies the base-directory global DAT_00087520 into a stack
 *      buffer. DAT_00087520's real recovered content, already confirmed
 *      elsewhere in this very file (see its own declaration comment a
 *      few hundred lines up), is the literal string "\VOC00.WAV" -- a
 *      complete filename TEMPLATE, not a directory fragment.
 *   2. It computes two ASCII digit characters from param_1 via genuine
 *      divide-by-10 (confirmed in the disassembly: `Ordinal_2005` --
 *      the project's own div/mod helper -- is called twice with divisor
 *      10, once for the quotient and once for the remainder). This is
 *      PLAIN DECIMAL, unlike play_music_track's own filename digits
 *      (tens = track>>3, ones = track&7, fixed in a separate commit on
 *      this branch) -- confirmed by checking, not assumed by analogy.
 *   3. Those two digits are written in place over the "00" placeholder
 *      inside that same stack copy of "\VOC00.WAV" -- Ghidra printed
 *      the destination as three separate locals (acStack_220/local_21c/
 *      local_21b) only because of how it mis-split one contiguous
 *      11-byte stack buffer, not because they're independent values;
 *      the real ARM stack offsets (sp+0x8.."\VOC00.WAV"'s start,
 *      sp+0xc/sp+0xd == the two placeholder '0' characters) confirm
 *      they're all the same buffer. The result is a real "\VOCnn.WAV"
 *      string, nn = param_1 in two decimal digits.
 *   4. A second, unrelated-looking copy loop from DAT_00241f08 fills a
 *      different stack buffer, and `ce_strcat` appends the patched
 *      "\VOCnn.WAV" from step 3 onto the end of it. DAT_00241f08 is NOT
 *      a second filename template (the only other reader/writer of it,
 *      game.c's registry-install-dir lookup around
 *      RegQueryValueExW/load_string_resource_large, confirms it holds
 *      the game's install directory) -- so the real, full intent is
 *      "<install dir>\VOCnn.WAV", an absolute Windows path.
 *
 *   None of step 4's install-directory half matters for this port,
 *   though: RegQueryValueExW (ordinal_stubs.c) is a no-op stub that
 *   never actually fills its output buffer, so DAT_00241f08 resolves to
 *   an empty string at runtime here regardless -- the real effective
 *   path this build would ever produce is just "\VOCnn.WAV", exactly
 *   matching the real, loose data/SOUND/VOCnn.wav files that already
 *   ship with the game (confirmed: VOC00.wav..VOC65.wav, 42 files, real
 *   8-bit PCM) and exactly matching platform_sfx.c's own prior note
 *   about this sibling pool's path convention. So this backend just
 *   builds "\SOUND\VOCnn.wav" directly and resolves it the normal way
 *   (uw_resolve_win_path/uw_file_fopen), skipping the dead install-dir
 *   concatenation entirely rather than reimplementing an absolute
 *   Windows path lookup that can never produce anything but "" here.
 *
 * Why single-voice instead of reusing platform_sfx's 16-voice mixer:
 * the real decompiled body's own logic is "wait for any currently-
 * playing sample to finish [a `do { } while (is_sfx_trigger_slot_active)`
 * spin] before arming the new one" -- i.e. one voice line at a time,
 * interrupting/replacing, never overlapping. A fresh small backend with
 * exactly that shape is simpler and more honest than bolting a
 * single-voice restriction onto the mixer built for the other pool.
 *
 * Live-crash finding this change also neutralizes: is_voice_sample_finished's
 * real decompiled body (unlike play_numbered_voice_sample's own) has NO
 * `DAT_0023c3b8 == 0` guard at all -- it unconditionally calls
 * is_sfx_trigger_slot_active(DAT_0023c3b8, 0), which dereferences
 * `*(char*)(param_2*0xd + param_1 + 0x10410)` with param_1 (DAT_0023c3b8)
 * always NULL, i.e. a raw read of address 0x10410. That's only ever
 * reached once a babl conversation line sets the "voice forced on" flag
 * (babl.c's render_babl_dialog_window, bit 0x40) and babl_render_tick
 * polls it -- a real, reachable path during ordinary dialogue, not a
 * hypothetical. Replacing this function's whole body with a direct
 * return of the real platform_voice_is_finished() value (not merely
 * prepending a call and falling through, the shape used for
 * play_numbered_voice_sample/stop_voice_sample below, both of which DO
 * have a safe NULL guard already) avoids ever reaching that dereference.
 *
 * load_voice_sample_page/read_voice_sample_page_chunk (audio.c), despite
 * their names, were checked and are NOT part of this pool: their only
 * real caller (babl.c's render_babl_dialog_window, inside the
 * illustrated book/scroll-viewer branch) streams their output straight
 * into ce_memmove(64000 bytes)/decompress_rle_stream/
 * bitmap_blit_to_framebuffer -- i.e. they page in 320x200 RLE/raw
 * bitmap ANIMATION FRAMES for the picture viewer, not audio. (This
 * project's own test grouping already bundles them with
 * render_babl_dialog_window/decompress_rle_stream/bitmap_blit_to_framebuffer
 * under the "illustration_render" suite, independently agreeing.) Left
 * completely untouched here.
