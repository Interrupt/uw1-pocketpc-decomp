# UW1 object conversion

Reference revision: `ac72dd9155e4bd3ab76257fa5daca080f23f2bbf` of
https://github.com/hankmorgan/UWReverseEngineering.

Use the UW1 object layout in `UW-Formats/uw-formats (Underworld Adventures).txt`,
sections 4.2 and 6.2, and `File Research/Game Object Research File.xlsx`.
Do not substitute `CommonObjDat UW2.xlsx`, `Player_Dat (UW2).xls`, or UW2 tables.
The research workbook includes notes about both games: verify each adopted
field against the UW1 format and this ARM port's actual consumers.

The native COMOBJ record is **13 bytes**, even though the UW1 disk row is
11 bytes. `load_object_catalog_data` inserts a byte before monetary value
and leaves a byte after description flags. Preserve that layout. The bit at
native offset 8, bit 7, means *can have an owner*, not *is a container*.

Object slots have an eight-byte common header. Mobile slots are 27 bytes;
NPC state and projectile coordinates occupy overlapping bytes. Only use
NPC fields for NPC/player slots and projectile fields for moving items.
`object_layout` exhaustively checks extraction and writes against independent
UW1 masks, including neighbouring bytes and native COMOBJ padding.

## Semantic patches

Coccinelle/spatch 1.3.3 was used for this sweep. Generated patches are checked
in alongside their generators, so reviewers can inspect exactly what ran.

```
python3 tools/coccinelle/generate_player_rules.py
python3 tools/coccinelle/generate_property_rules.py
spatch --sp-file tools/coccinelle/player-fields.cocci --dir src --no-includes --in-place
spatch --sp-file tools/coccinelle/object-properties.cocci --dir src --no-includes --in-place
spatch --sp-file tools/coccinelle/property-fields.cocci --dir src --no-includes --in-place
```

`property-pointers.cocci` converts row-address arithmetic at proven consumers.
Run it on each file separately: spatch accepts only one positional input file.
Saved COMOBJ offsets at the matched `iVar*` and `_iv` access sites were checked
to be `object_id * 13`; the patch divides the saved value rather than evaluating
a potentially changed object ID again.

`player-storage-boundaries.cocci` is the temporary migration step that keeps
remaining byte/word arithmetic in its original units as the player global is
retyped. Those accesses are **not converted fields**. Do not count explicit
casts as completion. `object-weight.cocci` converts the weight function, and
`object-weight-callers.cocci` marks its temporary typed call boundaries. Assignments were explicitly retyped once; the retained patch is idempotent.

`object-returns.cocci` changes the eleven allocation, lookup and relocation APIs
to return `uw_object_hdr_t *`, including their declarations and test doubles.
Compiler incompatible-pointer diagnostics now identify raw-pointer receivers.
Explicit casts hide those diagnostics, and pointer arithmetic can still compile
with different units after retyping: inspect both before converting a caller.
Do not silence the migration diagnostics globally.

`audit_object_roles.py` uses `build/compile_commands.json` and Clang ASTs to
identify object pointers from catalog accesses, object lookup calls and proven
aliases. It excludes locals reused as unrelated buffers. The generated
`object-pointer-roles.json` records the evidence and exclusions; it is an
incomplete audit, not proof that all object accesses have been found.
`generate_header_field_rules.py` generates function-scoped common-header read
patches from that audit. Apply them with `apply_header_field_rules.py`; use
`--check` to verify a second application makes no changes. These read patches
retain explicit header casts until caller declarations and arithmetic migrate.

`core-object-receivers.cocci` converts the chain/world search receivers and
their common-header reads. `object-link-interfaces.cocci` types packed link
and cursor parameters; `object-chain-interfaces.cocci` distinguishes those
parameters from the object headers passed to list operations. These interface
patches also apply to declarations and test doubles. `object-chain-storage.cocci`
converts list writes and recursive deletion without changing traversal order.
`spawn-object-header.cocci` replaces creation's byte stores with equivalent
header assignments, including the original quantity/container classification.
`object-arena-boundaries.cocci` casts the original computed byte addresses to
header pointers at allocation and resolution boundaries. The arena globals
themselves still need conversion.

`header-words/` contains generated, function-scoped rules for remaining whole
header words at the audited pointer roles. They expose `type_flags`,
`position_word`, `chain_word` and `link_word`; direct signed-short aliases
are excluded because their promotions differ. Regenerate with
`generate_header_word_rules.py` and apply/check with
`apply_header_field_rules.py --patch-dir tools/coccinelle/header-words`.
These casts still require a subsequent declaration/API migration.

`container-object-interfaces.cocci` types disposal, rune insertion and stack
inspection interfaces. Container weight traversal and matching-object locals
are covered by `core-object-receivers.cocci`. The core tests also exercise
nested contents weights and stack eligibility using the actual game functions.

`object_core` runs the real creation, link-resolution, search, insertion,
append and unlink functions. It compares creation to independent packed byte
values for all 512 types and checks both arena strides, nested contents,
quantity exclusions, next-link updates and preservation of adjacent low bits.

`current-mobile-object.cocci` types the current 27-byte slot pointer and
replaces common physical byte/header accesses. `current-mobile-fields.cocci`
reads the extended NPC fields only in NPC functions; projectile coordinate
words are excluded. Signed byte views retain their original signedness.
Residual word indexing uses explicit temporary word casts so retyping cannot
change its units. `npc-context-interfaces.cocci` types the context-setting
APIs, and `npc-state-setters.cocci` converts goal and target writes.
`projectile-tick.cocci` gives the non-NPC physics tick its own projectile
pointer, lifetime, pitch flags and tile coordinates.

`npc_state` runs the actual setters and independently checks all 65,536
target words, goal/target truncation, preserved animation/status bits and
the unchanged-target path flags. It does not imply that all NPC consumers
or the other projectile APIs have been migrated.

`uw_monster_type_props_t` and `uw_monster_attack_props_t` recover the UW1
OBJECTS.DAT critter table from `File Research/objects_dat-critters.xls` and
the ARM consumers. There are 64 packed 48-byte rows; the loader copies exactly
0xc00 bytes from disk offset 0x132. The last byte keeps an unknown name.
`monster-storage.cocci` migrates the table and fixture storage; its size rules
cover both sizeof forms and repairs byte-view sizes. Comma-separated fixture
declarations were split explicitly because spatch did not migrate those.
`monster-properties.cocci` replaces audited aliases and byte indexes with
properties. `monster-template-pointer.cocci` types the current NPC template
and preserves signed char views. `monster-table-boundaries.cocci` handles
armor/attack selection, XP, trading words and guarded spell-slot selection.
Unused field aliases have been removed; the base byte-address boundary still
serves remaining raw player/despawn template pointers.

Layout tests check every documented field offset, and `npc_combat` compares
all loaded rows with the independent on-disk byte block. This is stronger
than merely checking a few creature stats.

## UW1 weapon and wearable property rows

`ranged-storage.cocci` and `ranged-properties.cocci` convert the 16 three-byte
ranged rows to `uw_ranged_type_props_t`. The UW1 research spreadsheet identifies
bytes 0/1/2 as damage, projectile speed and an ammo/damage-type selector; ARM
consumers confirm these uses. The selector remains unsigned storage, with the
original explicit signed casts preserved where required. It is not named
"durability" from the less specific DOS format description.

`melee-armor-storage.cocci` and `melee-armor-properties.cocci` convert melee
(16 rows of eight bytes) and wearable (32 rows of four bytes) storage, loaders,
fixed field accesses and row addresses. Melee charge-field interpretations are
still tentative in the reference. Raw attack-data interfaces that can select
either a melee or ranged row retain temporary byte-pointer boundaries.

Byte-index rules divide by the record stride only at audited alias accesses:
all current ranged byte indices are row multiples of three. Mixed declarations
in fixtures were explicitly split before applying storage patches. Preserve
whole-array `sizeof` expressions before creating byte views for I/O.

`npc_combat` invokes the real `load_armor_variant_tables` and compares all
304 bytes against an independent disk read, including the final file offset.
Layout tests verify each field offset. Synthetic semantic tests check coverage,
unrelated-buffer exclusion, signed casts, buffer sizes and idempotence. A repeat
sweep over both source and tests produces no further changes.

## UW1 container, light and animation rows

`container-light-animation-storage.cocci` and
`container-light-animation-properties.cocci` convert container (16 * 3),
light (16 * 2), and animation (16 * 4) tables, fixed fields and loader sizes.
The detailed UW1 container spreadsheet establishes a two-byte acceptance mask
at offset 1; retain the inventory code's signed-short interpretation.
ARM light consumers and shipped data establish decay interval at byte 0 and
brightness at byte 1, despite the general format text describing them in the
opposite order. No lighting or decay arithmetic is changed.

Animation flags occupy the first word; start frame and frame count occupy
bytes 2 and 3. Rules repair the typed row-address form as well as the original
byte-address form, so rule ordering cannot leave raw flag casts behind.
Equipment handling now has typed armor/light-property locals. The generic
class dispatcher still returns an opaque pointer because its eight branches
return different record types; completing its consumers remains in scope.

The real loaders are exercised in `npc_combat`, comparing every container,
light and animation disk byte and final file offsets. `object_layout` checks
sizes/offsets and all 65,536 signed acceptance-word values independently.
Synthetic tests exercise exclusions, signed casts, scoped receiver types,
whole-array sizes, and repeatability.

`scratch-object.cocci` types the shared current-object inspection pointer and
its saved context as common headers, replaces first-word accesses and equips
callers directly from typed return values. The monster property lookup now
uses a typed header local and a typed property row address.

The player field generator also emits full-word rules after its narrower
bitfield rules. These replace reads saved into temporaries and masked updates
at the common-header, goal, status, target and tile-word offsets. For example,
`*(ushort *)((char *)g_player_object + 0x16)` becomes
`g_player_object->tile_word`; the x/y components remain separately named fields.
Synthetic tests cover full-word reads and writes and exclude unrelated buffers.

## Full-word and partial-byte object accesses

`generate_word_access_rules.py` generates `object-word-accesses.cocci` for the
player/current-mobile globals and `header-bytes/*.cocci` for independently
audited common-header receivers. The rules cover full unsigned/signed word
views, byte-pointer/index forms, word-pointer byte views, and partial writes.
Adjacent low/high writes from the same scalar identifier become a single word
assignment. Other partial writes retain their sequencing through named low/high
union members. Signed reads retain their original promotion; signed writes
preserve their low eight bits. Byte aliases do not enlarge any packed record.

The current-mobile extended words are scoped to proven NPC contexts; projectile
coordinates overlap those bytes and must retain the projectile layout. The low
four bits of the NPC tile word are now `npc_path_slot`, confirmed by the cached
walk-path consumers. The rule sweeps use that field for path-slot extraction.

Apply the header rules with:

```
python3 tools/coccinelle/apply_header_field_rules.py \
  --patch-dir tools/coccinelle/header-bytes
```

`object_layout` independently checks every byte/signed/unsigned view against
all 65,536 word values and verifies that partial writes preserve neighboring
bytes. Semantic tests cover paired writes, distinct-source partial writes,
signed reads, index forms, NPC/projectile exclusion and repeatability. This
extends the migration coverage; remaining object roles still require auditing.

The audit also found two legacy scaling errors in
`npc_combat_position_tick` (ARM `FUN_00031214`) and
`npc_combat_disengage_tick` (ARM `FUN_00031a94`). A read-only Ghidra decompile
and instruction dump confirms byte offsets +2 (position), +9 (heading),
+0xb/+0xc (goal/frame), and +0x13..0x19 (motion/animation/path flags).
The existing ushort-pointer boundaries doubled those offsets, including writes
past the 27-byte record. Earlier compatibility sweeps preserved that mistake.

`generate_npc_combat_byte_offsets.py` generates the repair; apply it only via
`apply_npc_combat_byte_offsets.py`, which isolates these two original function
bodies and invokes spatch before reinserting them in place. It also corrects
fields produced from the doubled offsets. Do not apply that context-specific
patch globally. The runner skips already-correct contexts and is idempotent.
The `npc_state` regression exercises all 65,536 goal words, both disengagement
branches and random frame advancement, checking independent bytes plus guards
around the mobile record. A second regression covers combat positioning
across all Z values and frame nibbles, including the flight-pitch threshold,
heading changes and preserved neighboring storage. Synthetic tests verify
the repair leaves unrelated functions untouched.

## Remaining full-goal work

* Finish player packed writes, whole-word reads, local aliases and call interfaces.
* Finish class-relative COMOBJ aliases (`DAT_002034b5`, `_DAT_002035cf`) and
  diagnostic/fixture byte accesses. Preserve the current four-byte interpretation
  of `_DAT_002035cf` until ARM evidence establishes whether it should be a word.
* Type remaining common-object APIs and their callers with `uw_object_hdr_t *`.
  `calculate_object_weight` is converted and has direct branch coverage; its
  existing callers retain temporary explicit header casts.
* Convert NPC and projectile consumers separately with proven pointer roles.
* Recover and convert object movement snapshots and relevant object class records.
* Finish mixed melee/ranged attack-data interfaces and row-relative field accesses.
* Finish food and class-6 scalar property tables and class-dispatch interfaces.
* Finish the player/despawn template pointers and dynamic property accesses.
* Migrate fixtures to typed objects while retaining independent byte-layout tests.
* Remove temporary boundaries; audit all object offsets across all source files.
* Build the game and every unit suite after each sweep. Verify semantic-patch
  coverage and idempotence, not only whether the resulting code compiles.

No game function is moved to a different source file during this work.

Validation includes the game build, all 53 C unit suites, conversion regressions,
and focused sanitizer checks. The latest
AddressSanitizer pass covers 19 consumers: babl_objects/throw/throw_cursor/npc_state/npc_combat/npc_ai/creatures/
combat/object_layout/object_core/movement/scheduler/spells/chargen/inventory/
lighting/sleep/teleport/babl_vm. This is a checkpoint for continuing the full
migration, not a completion claim.

## Shared mobile position synchronization

`generate_position_sync_rules.py` emits `position-sync-accesses.cocci` and
`position-sync-updates.cocci` for `sync_object_tile_position`. Apply the access
patch first, then the update patch, with the usual header/type include options.
The arena test proves 27-byte mobile storage before extended fields are used.
The snapshot builder and synchronizer establish shared health/lifetime,
collision-state mode, speed, gravity, pitch and tile-coordinate views. These
aliases preserve existing NPC and projectile layouts; NPC goal/status/target
words retain their distinct meaning. Only the explicit non-NPC branch uses
`uw_projectile_object_t::precise_x/y/z`.

Header position and static quality writes use individual properties. Shared
tile updates preserve the reserved low nibble, and movement-mode writes retain
the tick phase and upper flag. Speed preserves the gravity value installed
earlier in this function; the intervening division does not access the record.
All original scalar snapshots and formulas remain, including full packed
temporary values even when the record update uses a single property.
Callers supply separate stack/global placement snapshots; their raw buffer
offsets remain additional migration work, rather than object properties.

`position_sync_fields` extracts the actual game function and checks 524,288
NPC/projectile/static cases against independent byte expectations, including
all surrounding storage. `--asan` enables direct sanitizer checks. For a batch
review, `--reference PATH` additionally compares a saved original source with
the current function, including memory at service calls, return values,
snapshot mutations and tile globals. The original and converted functions
agree over 4,194,304 cases spanning relocation, landing failures, off-map
tiles and damage callbacks. The same run checks complete conversion and
idempotence against the saved original. The object-layout suite checks every
new alias and property against byte offsets and masks. This pass removes all
23 raw audited accesses in synchronization. Remaining raw accesses elsewhere
are tracked by the property-usage inventory.

## Shared mobile consumers

`generate_shared_mobile_rules.py` emits function- and receiver-scoped recipes
in `shared-mobile/`. `apply_shared_mobile_rules.py --in-place --jobs 4` applies
them to temporary copies of the reviewed functions and reinserts each body at
its original location. `--check` verifies that no additional changes are pending.
Original pointer declarations determine byte scaling; signed byte reads retain
their casts. The pass names common header fields, tile coordinates, scheduling
phase, movement mode, speed, gravity, pitch and fine heading. Scaled tile reads
retain their multiplication by eight through `tile_x/y << 3`.

The snapshot builder guards extended storage with the mobile arena boundary.
Its non-NPC branch alone reads projectile precise coordinates. The settling
function reads the projectile source slot only in its non-NPC branch, and the
reallocation diagnostic reads signed precise Z only for projectile class 0x80.
Saved local pointers remain local when calls change the selected global object.
Mixed attacker/current-object consumers use only shared byte views; raw NPC
goal/status/target words and unresolved byte-26 accesses remain further work.
Monster-table `movement_flags` is excluded from mobile scheduling rules.
Complete byte-field writes use named properties, including XOR inserts whose
values contain only scalar identifiers, masks, shifts and numeric literals.
Calls and repeated memory expressions are excluded from those value recipes.
The refreshed audit records 279 proven pointer roles across 47 sources and
61 remaining raw accesses at audited sites, down from 115 before this batch.

`shared_mobile_fields` extracts the actual placement snapshot builder and
checks 196,608 NPC/projectile/static cases against independent byte expectations,
including untouched snapshot bytes, object storage and random-call counts.
`--reference PATH` additionally compares a saved original builder; `--asan`
enables sanitizer checks. Receiver fixtures check word, character and void
pointer scaling, signed reads, unrelated fields, scope exclusions and idempotence.

## NPC summon and interaction fields

`generate_npc_interaction_rules.py` emits the function-scoped recipes in
`npc-interactions/`; `--in-place` applies them, and `--check` verifies the
current source is stable. Access conversion precedes adjacent packed-store
consolidation and property updates. Functions stay at their original locations.

Summon initialization names header XYZ, static quality, mobile tile coordinates,
NPC attitude and target coordinates. Only variant 4 allocates and initializes
an NPC, so its status and target words never label the caster or static spawn.
Other caster extensions use the shared mobile layout. Noise reactions and BABL
race updates set `npc_attitude` while preserving the lower fourteen status bits.
The scripted conversation sets identity, attitude and goal through a typed NPC
pointer, then frees its common header. BABL traversal retains the original
chain-field address when its local record pointer becomes typed.

Packed scalar snapshots retain their original values across calls and property
updates. The conversation's two pure snapshots are removed only after a scoped
check proves they have no remaining use or escaped address; volatile snapshots
are excluded. Unknown movement bit 7 and AI flag bits keep explicit masks on
named byte views. Status bit 9 remains unnamed; this batch supplies no evidence
for assigning it a semantic property.

`npc_interaction_fields` extracts the four actual game functions and runs
712,704 cases against independent byte expectations. Coverage includes all
65,536 status values, summon variants, NPC/player casters, placement failures,
noise filtering, conversation cleanup and BABL race filtering. Service mocks
observe records and deliberately change selected global pointers. `--asan`
enables sanitizer checks; `--reference-dir PATH` compares saved original sources
at every service call, including record bytes, arguments, random calls, messages
and final pointer identities. It also verifies complete original-to-current
conversion and idempotence. The refreshed audit records 280 proven pointer
roles and 30 remaining raw accesses at audited sites, down from 61.

## Packed-byte reassembly

`generate_packed_reassembly_rules.py` generates `packed-reassembly.cocci`.
Apply with `spatch --sp-file tools/coccinelle/packed-reassembly.cocci src/FILE.c
--no-includes --in-place`; omit `--in-place` to check for remaining conversions.
The rules collapse `CONCAT11` high/low aliases of the same named packed word,
and byte views that reconstruct an existing 16-bit pointer element. The latter
retain an unsigned-short cast, including when the original lvalue is signed.
Identifier constraints exclude receivers with calls or increments. Explicit
function-scoped rules cover audited byte-only object aliases, NPC goal words,
and the two cached-low-byte expressions in the container stacking branch.

The semantic regression compiles and executes both original and converted code
for all 65,536 word values. It checks signed low bytes, signed word promotion,
outer signed casts, member and cast receivers, and container cached bytes.
Mismatched fields/receivers, side effects, and untyped byte buffers remain
unchanged; a second application must produce identical output. Concatenations
that assemble separate values or update only part of a value remain valid.

## Named position operations

`generate_position_field_rules.py` generates `position-fields.cocci` and
`position-dead-temporaries.cocci`. Apply them in that order. Complete
read/modify/write sequences for `zpos`, `heading`, `ypos`, and `xpos` become
bitfield assignments; exact field extraction masks become named reads.
Both whole-word and matching two-byte stores are supported. Fine headings
inserted with `(value & 0xe0) << 2` become `(value >> 5) & 7` assignments.
Receiver and input identifiers exclude calls/increments. Wider insertion masks
are deliberately excluded because they may also change adjacent fields.

The conversion initially preserves the temporary's original packed result.
The cleanup patch removes its reload only where a control-flow match proves it
unused before function exit or an independent overwrite. A conservative RHS
name filter rejects overwrites that read the temporary. Explicitly documented
function/variable pairs cover manually audited goto-heavy NPC routines beyond
the generic pattern's reach. Do not generalize those exceptions to other
functions or variables without checking every path.

Regression coverage compiles and executes original and converted updates for
all 65,536 initial words and twelve input values (including out-of-range values),
checking the changed property, preserved neighboring header fields, returned
packed temporaries, conditional overwrites, wider-mask exclusion, and repeatability.

## Documented field reads and remaining-access inventory

`struct_field_catalog.py` lists the documented packed properties already
present in `uw.h`; reserved fields and the layout-only `npc_ai_flags_low7` view
are excluded. `generate_named_field_read_rules.py` generates
`named-field-reads.cocci` from that catalog. It covers unsigned/signed word
masks, unsigned/signed byte views, byte casts, and shifted comparisons.
A signed high-word shift is retained unless a mask bounds the result.
Comparisons use exact enumerated constants, so an out-of-field comparison
value cannot accidentally become true after truncation.

`named_struct_fields` compiles and executes original and transformed code
against the actual UW1 structs for 893 read expressions and all 65,536 input
words. It checks that candidates actually become named properties, compares
complete output checksums, preserves signed/cross-field/reserved exceptions,
and verifies repeatability. The independent `object_layout` suite checks the
binary layouts separately.

Run `python3 tools/coccinelle/audit_struct_property_usage.py --json
 tools/coccinelle/struct-property-usage.json` after each sweep. The inventory
tracks remaining named packed views and raw accesses at existing audited
object-pointer sites. It is deliberately a work list: entries are not blanket
exceptions, and it does not prove coverage of unrecorded aliases, tiles,
current-view storage, or property-row pointers that still need auditing.

Remaining work includes multi-field and XOR updates, paired byte stores,
raw aliases and interfaces, scalar-temporary field extraction, and documenting
which surviving whole-word operations are actual encoding/copy boundaries.
The goal is not complete while these remain unreviewed.

## Saved current-NPC aliases and packed writes

`audit_object_roles.py` records `current_mobile_alias` only when every
non-null assignment is the current mobile pointer or another proven saved
alias. Mixed object/accessor aliases remain common-object roles; aliases reused
for unrelated storage are excluded. `generate_current_alias_rules.py` emits
function-scoped `current-aliases/*.cocci`, respecting the original pointer's
byte/word scaling and signed views. It retains the saved pointer, because a
nested operation may change `DAT_0010190c`. NPC contexts are explicitly scoped;
projectile consumers must not inherit NPC fields at overlapping offsets.

`generate_named_field_write_rules.py` emits `named-field-writes.cocci` from
the documented catalog. Complete field insertions, clears, sets and contained
byte XOR updates become named assignments. Matching split-byte stores can be
combined. When the original calculation assigned a temporary, its final packed
value is reloaded after the field assignment so later uses retain their value.
Reserved-bit, cross-field and wider insertion masks remain unchanged. Rules
restrict receivers and insertion values to identifiers to avoid changing
side-effect evaluation. Multi-field and noncanonical sequences remain work.

`named_struct_writes` executes original and converted updates against the
actual UW1 structs for 207 update patterns, every initial word and six insertion
values, including
out-of-range values. It checks neighboring storage and live packed temporaries,
requires conversion of every candidate, and verifies exclusions and idempotence.
`current_object_aliases` uses the real Clang audit on a fixture, verifies mixed
and reused-pointer exclusions, and executes both versions after switching the
global current object to verify saved-pointer identity and word-offset scaling.

## Packed copies and declaration-aware header aliases

`generate_packed_store_rules.py` emits `packed-stores.cocci`. Adjacent low/high
stores of the same scalar become one unsigned 16-bit assignment. Identifier
receivers preserve evaluation counts, and an intervening statement or a
mismatched source prevents conversion. These whole-word operations are genuine
copies/encoding; the temporary remains unchanged. Property table casts use
`uw_object_type_props_t`, rather than the mobile object layout.

`packed_struct_stores` checks 234 combinations of receiver and cast spelling
against the actual structs for all 65,536 low words and both signs, preserving
neighboring storage. It requires coverage and idempotence and excludes mismatched
sources and intervening modifications.

The refreshed header generators consume the current Clang role audit, including
saved current-object aliases. `generate_word_access_rules.py` groups aliases by
both name and declaration type. It can therefore convert bare byte/word indexes
and dereferences without guessing their scaling. A `ushort *` offset of one is
two bytes; a `char *` offset of one is one byte. Signed char address-taking has
its own rule, before read conversion, so the result remains an addressable
lvalue. The semantic regression checks both pointer scales, signed stores,
addresses, unrelated-function exclusions and repeatability.

Named packed-write alternatives are grouped per receiver/property in the
emitter. This retains the same match cases and temporary-preservation behavior
while avoiding a separate rule for every spelling. Run the generators after
refreshing pointer roles, apply header fields before header byte views, then
apply packed stores, named reads and named writes. Review surviving snapshots,
partial-field/multi-field updates, and noncanonical byte copies separately;
these remain active migration work rather than blanket exceptions.

`generate_packed_store_rules.py` also emits `packed-field-copies.cocci`.
Adjacent low/high assignments from the same named source word become one
whole-word assignment, including narrowed whole-word and direct byte-view
sources. Apply with `--all-includes --include-headers-for-types -I . -I src`.
Receiver identifiers exclude side effects, and both writes must copy the same
member from the same source without intervening statements. Review matches
against object roles before applying: this pass assumes valid object records
that are disjoint or identical, not partially overlapping raw buffers or
volatile/device storage. The current matches copy records from object slots
into newly allocated slots in relocation, stack splitting, and traps.

`packed_field_copies` checks all 792 source/destination/cast combinations over
all 65,536 words using the real structs, including self-aliasing pointer forms,
source and neighboring bytes, mismatched-source and intervening-write
exclusions, and idempotence. Twenty paired copies across four game sources
are now whole-word assignments. Mixed-value byte updates remain for a later
property-write pass.

The scalar `packed-stores.cocci` rules also combine paired stores of the same
identifier masked, OR'd or XOR'd with a numeric literal. Limiting the operand
to a literal avoids ambiguous identifier matches in Coccinelle and excludes
memory reads or side effects inside the repeated expression. Distinct masks,
values, destination members and intervening writes stay separate. Five more
pairs in game reset, save preparation and object callbacks now assign the
complete word; their old scalar snapshots remain unchanged.

`packed_struct_stores` verifies 1008 scalar/cast/receiver forms over all 65,536
words with positive and negative inputs, checking neighboring bytes, exclusion
cases and idempotence. Pass `--asan` after the `spatch` argument for sanitizer
coverage. These packed assignments preserve the original mask expressions;
mapping those updates to individual documented properties remains further work.

## Projectile spawn fields

`generate_projectile_spawn_rules.py` emits `projectile-spawn-fields.cocci` for
`spawn_object_near_player` (ARM `FUN_0004ad10`). Its allocated mobile record
undergoes projectile physics until landing. The pass uses a typed projectile
pointer, combines coordinate byte stores into `precise_x/y/z`, and names
tile coordinates, heading, pitch, speed, source slot and common-header fields.
The packed `tile_position` view retains the reserved low nibble for diagnostic
word prints; ordinary coordinate consumers use `tile_x/y`.

Launch-header updates retain the original packed and byte snapshots. The
height calculations still use `bVar1 & 0x7f` to extract the saved original Z
coordinate after the live Z field changes; replacing it with the live field
would change the crouch branch. Remaining whole-word/byte reads cache packed
values or print diagnostics. The animation high-bit clear has no documented
property name. Explicit header/word casts remain at existing API boundaries.
No function moves, and NPC coordinate interpretations are excluded.
The pointer-role audit and dependent header patches are refreshed against the
typed declarations. Raw word-index patterns are retained only for word
pointers or explicit word casts, so record-pointer arithmetic keeps its scale.

Apply with `--all-includes --include-headers-for-types -I . -I src`.
The scoped recipes disable unnecessary arithmetic isomorphisms, and inserted
shifts carry explicit parentheses to preserve precedence inside larger sums.
`projectile_spawn_fields` compares all bytes, neighboring guards, source
records, live snapshots and side effects for 65,536 inputs in four modes,
including signed coordinate truncation, unsigned launch controls and failed
allocation. It verifies scope and idempotence. Add `--asan` after the `spatch`
argument for direct sanitizer coverage. The actual old and converted spawn
functions were also compared with the same 262,144-case harness under ASAN,
covering both template roles, height/drop rejection and source-slot branches;
the game throw suites exercise flight, bounce and landing.

## NPC spawn fields

`generate_npc_spawn_rules.py` emits `npc-spawn-fields.cocci` for
`init_monster_spawn_defaults` (ARM `FUN_0002a35c`). Its caller selects a newly
spawned creature before invoking it. This establishes NPC layout for the saved
scratch pointer within this function; other scratch and projectile consumers
remain separate audits. The pass replaces byte offsets with a typed NPC
pointer, names complete property updates and heading reads, and types the
monster-table row so HP reads use `max_hp` instead of row byte 4. Apply with
`--all-includes --include-headers-for-types -I . -I src`.

The update recipes retain every original packed snapshot, including when an
OR insertion forces a bit that the original clear mask retained. Status bits
4..12 have no documented property names, so their individual clears remain
explicit operations on `status_word`. Masks in motion, animation, attack,
heading and AI control bytes retain their original operations: their complete
bytes have names, but the remaining individual flag meanings are undocumented.
These are specific exceptions, not a claim that the surrounding migration is
complete.

The spawn initializer's unused `uVar1` snapshots have a separate, guarded
cleanup: `generate_npc_spawn_rules.py --cleanup-dead-snapshots`. It folds the
adjacent snapshot/mask/store pairs to `npc->status_word &= mask`, removes
unused snapshots and the local declaration, then checks that no reference to
the temporary remains. Any later use, escaped address, unfamiliar assignment
or volatile access rejects the entire cleanup. The underlying spawn patch
still preserves live snapshots; the cleanup only operates on this audited
initializer. Legacy status bits remain explicit masks until their meanings
are established.

`generate_mobile_tick_rules.py` emits `mobile-tick-phase.cocci`. The low nibble
at mobile offset 0x0a is now `tick_phase`: `npc_ai_tick` advances it modulo 16
and `tick_mobile_objects` passes it to the due-time check. Spawn clears this
property directly, retaining the upper nibble. Rules are scoped to proven
mobile receivers; the monster-table byte also named `movement_flags` has
different meanings and is excluded. This field is intentionally absent from
the unscoped byte-field catalog. `object_layout` checks its packing and writes
over 65,536 values, and `npc_spawn_fields` checks all phase byte values,
cleanup exclusions, idempotence and the actual initializer's bytes.

`npc_spawn_fields` checks offset conversions, signed reads/stores/addresses,
table HP signedness, live snapshots, exclusions and idempotence across all
65,536 input words. It extracts the actual game initializer and compares all
27 bytes plus surrounding guards with independently indexed expected bytes
for 65,536 record seeds and 50 random inputs each. Run the same regression
with `--asan` after the `spatch` argument for direct AddressSanitizer coverage.

## NPC death fields

`generate_npc_death_rules.py` emits `npc-death-fields.cocci` for
`initiate_npc_death` and `handle_monster_death` in `src/ai.c`. Their existing
ARM notes establish full-object byte offsets at 0x345bc..0x3462c and
0x34638..0x34648. The rules name HP, identity, animation flags, attack state,
and goal-byte accesses through the original local pointer. Signed reads,
stores, and addresses remain separate so signed values and lvalues survive.
Apply the named-field write rules afterward to clear `npc_animation_frame`
without obscuring the goal/target fields or changing the packed temporary.

`npc_death_fields` checks all 65,536 initial goal words against the actual
mobile-object layout, covering all byte flag values, signed identity reads,
address-taking, neighboring storage, packed temporaries, unrelated-buffer and
projectile exclusions, and idempotence. The function scopes are intentional;
they do not establish NPC layout for other consumers of mobile arena slots.

## Partial-property reads

`generate_partial_field_read_rules.py` emits `partial-field-reads.cocci` for
masked slices contained wholly within a documented property. The subset masks
come from the remaining-access inventory: class/subclass indexes within
`object_id`, reserved flag bits, owner subcodes, quantity/link bits, quality
subcodes, and position slices. A slice of `object_id` still reads `object_id`;
it does not need the surrounding `type_flags` word.

Apply this pass with `--all-includes --include-headers-for-types -I . -I src`,
so Coccinelle knows the actual typedefs without rewriting headers. Do not use
`--no-includes`: without type information it can parse a narrowing byte cast
as part of a member receiver and retain that cast around the wider field.
`python3 tools/coccinelle/apply_partial_field_read_rules.py --in-place`
selects the proven patterns present in each source and supplies those options.
Use `--check` to fail on remaining matches, or omit both flags to preview.

The rules preserve the original slice's bit position when its numeric value
is used for indexing or encoding. Zero comparisons can omit that position.
Signed word and char views are supported only where a final mask discards
sign extension. Masks spanning properties, sign-extension bits outside the
original byte/word, and genuine packed copies remain unchanged. Both pointer
and value receivers retain their original evaluation count.

`partial_field_reads` executes every generated spelling and zero comparison
over all 65,536 input words using the actual object structs. It checks
conversion coverage, identical values, exclusions and repeatability.

## Audited void-pointer headers and BABL objects

The header generators support explicit byte-offset dereferences on audited
`void *` receivers: GNU C arithmetic on these pointers advances by bytes.
They do not emit bare void-pointer indexing. Layout evidence still comes
from the function-scoped Clang object-role audit, and this pass only covers
the eight-byte common header. Mobile extensions need their own role proof.

`apply_void_object_header_rules.py` applies field reads, storage views and
named reads sequentially on a temporary source copy before updating a file.
Use `--in-place` to apply, `--check` to verify idempotence, or neither to preview.
The driver supplies header/type include options. Positioned fields retain
parentheses in larger arithmetic; zero comparisons also cover the parentheses
retained around cast receivers.

`generate_babl_object_rules.py` emits `babl-object-fields.cocci` for the
position, quantity, quality and barter-total builtins. Their object receivers
use `uw_object_hdr_t *`; floor fallback uses `uw_tile_t::floor_height`.
VM argument offsets remain VM accesses. The x/y masks intentionally retain
the original masked `uVar7` snapshot; quality keeps the old chain/low-byte
temporaries. The z update reconstructs the complete `uVar8` word before the
final word store. These snapshots preserve original temporary values.

`void_object_headers` checks 118 read forms against original expressions over
all 65,536 words, including signed byte reads, stores and addresses, unrelated
buffers, extension exclusions and idempotence. Its standalone runner accepts
`--asan`. `babl_objects` extracts the five actual builtins and exhaustively
checks getters, sentinel and negative setters, floor fallback, quantity,
quality, barter results and neighboring storage. The same tests also pass
against the pre-conversion builtins. This batch removes 35 raw-access inventory
entries; 138 remain, alongside packed operations requiring further review.

### Projectile launch and settling fields

`generate_projectile_lifecycle_rules.py` generates the function-scoped
`projectile-lifecycle-fields.cocci` recipe for dropped items, ranged ammunition,
mobile arena replacement and settling. Launch copies header `quality` into
projectile `lifetime`, and saves header `heading` in `original_heading` at byte
26. Settling restores the three-bit header heading from that byte. Existing
item-class guards stay in place: byte 26 has other meanings in other record
layouts. These conversions never interpret projectile coordinate words as NPC
status or goal fields.

The settling recipe retains the resulting packed word in `uVar11`, so a live
consumer of that temporary remains valid. Its low-three-bit source mask also
makes the saved byte's truncation explicit. No service call or pointer capture
is moved. `test_projectile_lifecycle_fields.py` checks scope and idempotence,
compares entire record buffers against independent byte expectations for all
16,777,216 heading-byte/position-word combinations, and verifies the returned
word temporary. It tests the converted access sequences; the game unit tests
provide the surrounding function coverage. Optional `--asan` enables address
sanitization, and `--reference-dir` checks exact conversion of saved pre-change
source functions against their current bodies.

### Shared mobile consumers and locally proved NPC storage

The shared-mobile recipes also cover combat durability/health, collision
animation bytes, player-position access and picking diagnostics. These use
only fields common to NPC and projectile records. The `emit_tile_features`
height recipe names `precise_z` only after the existing non-NPC and mobile
arena gates, retaining its signed `short` interpretation. A typed player
receiver uses `g_player_object->hdr` directly.

`generate_mobile_consumer_rules.py` emits three narrower NPC conversions:
`detect_npc_wander_proximity` retains its saved current-NPC pointer when
clearing AI bit 0; `apply_melee_damage` tests status bit 10 through
`status_word_high` within its NPC armor branch; and `npc_ai_default_tick`
names the goal low-byte store only with the adjacent current-NPC capture and
snapshot sequence. The last function also uses `npc_rec` for other record
roles, so a function-wide NPC extension map would be unsafe. The original
snapshots, low/high store sequence and global receiver reads remain intact.
AI bit 0, status bit 10 and animation bits retain their masks because their
individual property meanings have not been verified.

`test_mobile_consumer_fields.py` checks 1,310,720 packed-byte cases before and
after the generated rules, with independent expected bytes for health,
animation, player height and NPC goal updates. It checks signed projectile
height, the saved word results, scope exclusions and idempotence, with
optional `--asan`. These are access-sequence regressions; the game unit tests
cover the surrounding consumers. Source audit counts remain a conservative
work list, not a completion certificate.

### NPC target, goal and animation updates

`generate_npc_goal_rules.py` generates `npc-goal-fields.cocci`. Its reviewed
function scopes name complete target-to-player updates, four adjacent
snapshot/frame cycles, the idle behavior frame store, and both branches of
`npc_clear_special_goal`. The target mask `0xf01f` plus `0x10` sets the entire
eight-bit `npc_gtarg` to 1, preserving goal and frame. The low-nibble XOR
copy in the special-goal fallback copies `npc_level` into `npc_goal`; it does
not toggle goal bits. Level zero instead selects goal 2 and target 0.

Frame cycles name `npc_animation_frame`, while retaining all original scalar
snapshots and modulo results. Saved-alias cases are restricted to functions
where inspection proves the alias and current receiver stay equal between
the snapshot and stores. No intervening callback or record write occurs in
those sequences. The target update stays before `refresh_npc_target_delta`,
and later operations continue reading the current receiver after callbacks.

`test_npc_goal_fields.py` extracts the real reaction and special-goal helpers.
Independent byte expectations cover 5,242,880 cases, including callback changes
to the current NPC, all packed goal words, every level, branch gates, and RNG
paths. A further 262,144 reduced frame cases check returned live snapshots,
neighboring bytes, scope and idempotence. `--asan` sanitizes both harnesses;
`--reference PATH` additionally compares callback-event hashes against saved
pre-change helpers and verifies exact source conversion of every changed
function. Unrelated packed goal snapshots and shared-label stores remain for
separate review.

### Player movement and teleport coordinates

`generate_player_position_rules.py` generates `player-position-fields.cocci`
for `commit_player_move`, `begin_directional_move` and
`set_player_tile_position`. It names shared tile coordinates, header fine
coordinates/height/heading, fine heading and clock-driven animation frame.
Masked scalar snapshots retain their original values. When a temporary held
the complete newly assembled word, the recipe assigns the property and then
captures that complete word in the same temporary. Callback boundaries and
current-player reads stay in place.

Teleport's `0xefff` mask followed by high-byte `0x0c` sets the entire three-bit
y coordinate to 3: it clears bit 12 and forces bits 10/11. Its corresponding
x formula selects 3. The chain reset clears the whole word, preserving the
old `next << 6` snapshot; the original intermediate assignment made quality
zero before its low-byte read, so both quality and next finish zero.

`test_player_position_fields.py` extracts the real movement commit. Independent
byte expectations cover 2,097,152 cases with tile relinking, signed heights,
turn interpolation, clock frames, landing paths and callback-selected player
records. Optional `--reference-dir` compares saved original movement event
hashes and exact source conversion of all three functions. A further 524,288
teleport field cases check fixed coordinates, chain clearing, preserved
snapshots, scope and idempotence. `--asan` sanitizes both harnesses.

The cross-word byte stores in `reset_player_object_record` required a
complete-function review; their verified zero-based reduction is described
below.

### Zero-based player record reset

`generate_player_reset_rules.py` generates `player-reset-fields.cocci`. The
complete original function body must match, including the full zero clear,
ordinary scalar temporary, exact stores and return. It cannot fold a partial
initializer with added callbacks, live/escaping temporary uses, a volatile
scalar or a different clear size. The recipe disables Coccinelle's optional
qualifier matching, so the volatile guard is enforced by the generated patch.

`ce_memset` in `ordinal_stubs.c` is the ordinary memory-only wrapper. After
its full record clear, the original cross-word byte reads are zero. The
transient door-direction bit is overwritten with zero before the final item
ID update. The final record is zero except item ID `0x7f` and status word
`0x00fd`, so the replacement uses those named fields and the schema's size.
The status initializer intentionally remains a whole-word literal: its bits
4-7 have no verified property names. No meaning is inferred for those bits.

`test_player_reset_fields.py` compiles the actual reset and the real memory
wrapper. Independent byte expectations and a saved original initializer
check 262,144 varied input records/slots, all surrounding guard bytes, pointer
identity and the single clear call. It also checks the complete-function
conversion, idempotence and all preservation guards. `--asan` enables address
sanitization; `--reference PATH` checks conversion of saved source.

## Inventory and held-item save-record words

`generate_inventory_record_rules.py` emits `inventory-record-words.cocci` for
`serialize_inventory_link_chain`, `deserialize_inventory_link_chain`,
`build_player_save_record`, and `restore_player_save_record`. These audited
copies transfer the eight-byte common header between the level arena and a
separate save buffer. Adjacent low/high byte stores become direct copies of
`type_flags`, `position_word`, `chain_word`, and `link_word`; unknown and
reserved bits are preserved. The player save's tile-chain clear uses `next`,
and held-item quantity tests use `is_quant`. The copy order, record allocation,
recursive traversal, equipment remapping, and live scalar values stay intact.

Apply the patch to `src/inventory.c` and `src/player.c` with `--all-includes
--include-headers-for-types -I . -I src --in-place`. The conversion test checks
exact source conversion and idempotence, excludes other functions, and rejects
merging pairs across callbacks. It executes the real before/after functions
through the cold-arena save fixture over 65,536 header-word values, comparing
all arena and save-buffer bytes, nested containers, equipped objects, quantity
stacks, and both quantity and container cursor items. `--reference-dir` accepts
saved original `inventory.c`/`player.c` files; `--asan` enables AddressSanitizer.

The remaining encoded-link masks in these helpers act on standalone link words
or save-index/equipment tables, whose storage is not an object header. Full
packed-word copies are intentional: replacing them with selected properties
would drop other header bits. The 27-byte player copy includes unnamed extension
bytes and remains a complete record copy rather than guessed NPC properties.

## Scripted trap-pair initialization

`generate_trap_pair_rules.py` emits `trap-pair-fields.cocci` for
`create_scripted_trap_pair_at_tile`. Both region-zero allocations are stationary
objects with a common header. The exact complete initializer names object IDs, the reserved
flag slice, enchanted/direction/invisibility/quantity bits, position components,
quality, next, owner, and link. The first marker faces heading zero; the second
keeps its existing heading. Both use sub-tile coordinates (3,3). Intermediate
position stores overwritten before the next callback are folded only when the
entire function, including every capture and call, matches. Added callbacks,
changed capture formulas, escaping/live observations, and volatile captures
prevent conversion. Scalar snapshots and their formulas remain in
place, including the second object's captured position/heading and type words.

Apply with `--all-includes --include-headers-for-types -I . -I src --in-place`.
`test_trap_pair_fields.py` checks exact old-to-current conversion, idempotence,
function scope, and rejection of added callbacks, changed captures, live or
escaping temporary observations, and volatile captures. The actual
before/after functions run through 393,216 cases covering all 65,536 initial
word patterns, code nibbles, signed tile coordinates, unchanged and callback-
mutated records, both allocation failures, full records, and surrounding guard
bytes. Callback observations include the complete records at each allocator,
tile lookup, index encoder, insertion, and free. `--reference` accepts the saved
original `traps.c`; `--asan` enables AddressSanitizer.

The tile-height byte extraction remains a tilemap operation outside the object
header schema. Full captured type/position/chain words and scalar masks remain
until a separate liveness-guarded cleanup proves them removable or narrows them
without changing an observed temporary. Other trap helpers' undocumented NPC
status bits still require independent semantic evidence.
